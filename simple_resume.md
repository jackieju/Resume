### Background
All below products/projects were 99% completed by me.

- When building the platform/middleware for stockstar.com, I created a **new computer language (script engine)**. I opensourced it in 2003, and modified it for gaming and moved it ot github at https://github.com/jackieju/mse 

- When building the platform for stockstar.com, I write a **data engine which cross linux/windows/aix and db2/mssql/oracle.**

- When work for Adways.net, as CTO. I build all dev process, technical infrastructure and responsible for new production/strategy research. In 2007, I design the new stragegy:1. SNS app, 2. IPhone App, 3. Ali App, which became  main income source in the later 10 years.

- In my startup in Singpore, I created a **iphone-brained robot**, with Arduino, in 2011. Video: https://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XNTk0NzcxODM2.html?spm=a2h0k.11417342.soresults.dtitle

- Write an ios game "xiakexing"(now renamed to https://itunes.apple.com/cn/app/%E4%BE%A0%E5%AE%A2%E8%A1%8C2/id543763319?mt=8), which was ever been **top 150 in game category.**

###  Currently
- Currently, I am working on SAP B1 Cloud NLP(natural language process) Sevice, desgin and code.

### Tips
- Basically I can do everything, software, hardware, C/C++ Java(but I hate Java) Php perl Ruby ASM Arduino, mysql, mssql, Unity3d, Photoshop... anything you can image or you cannot image about AI ( computer is a branch of AI in the aspect of  human-machine interactive in my opinion)

-  But I cannot win any "tech-interview" because my brain will just stop working for any tech-examination questions.

- I will refuse to use Java and XML (Although I have 10+ years JAVA experience and was SCJP), because all that stuff just make things complicated.

Thanks a lot for reading my Resume.
Have a nice day !
